**Note: This does not stop future notifications**


### Why did the bot not react to my message?
- First, check if you have any typos in the hashtag or the game name (compare against BGG)
- BGG search is a little funky with special characters,
if the game you're having issues with has them, try without the special characters 
- If you still have a problem with it, 
please create an issue on GitHub with as much detail as possible
