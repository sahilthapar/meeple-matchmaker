### How do I stop the notifications?
You can do this by sending a DM (direct message) to the bot
**Do not use these in the group chat, they add noise.******
- use `#found game-name` to disable notifications for a game you were searching for
- use `#sold game-name` to disable notifications for a game you were selling
- use `/disable` to disable all notifications for all game you've posted about
**Note: This does not stop future notifications**


### Why did the bot not react to my message?
- First, check if you have any typos in the hashtag or the game name (compare against BGG)
- BGG search is a little funky with special characters,
if the game you're having issues with has them, try without the special characters 
- If you still have a problem with it, 
please create an issue on GitHub with as much detail as possible
